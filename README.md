Problem Statement:

#Consider a real estate company that has a dataset containing the prices of properties in the Delhi region. It wishes to use the data to optimise the sale prices of the properties based on important factors such as area, bedrooms, parking, etc.


Machine Learning Workflow:

1. Extract Features

a. Features and target should not have any null values

b. Features should be numeric (handle categorical values)

c. Features should be of the type array/ dataframe

d. Features should be having some rows and columns

e. Features should be on the same scale

2. Split the dataset into training and testing datasets

3. Train the model on the training set

a. Import the necessary library

b. Instantiate an object

c. .fit() on training data

4. Test/ Evaluate the model on the testing set

a. .predict() on test data

b. Evaluate the performance (Compare the Actual vs. Predicted values)

c. If performance is not upto the mark, use performance optimization (Dimensionality Reduction, HPO, Change the ML algorithm)
